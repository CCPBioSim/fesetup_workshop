    "FESetup is a predominantly command line based tool. Executing commands in a notebook cell is possible but it is easier to work in a terminal. To open the terminal from the Jupyter home page click on New and then Terminal. To work with this notebook you will have to switch between the terminal tab and the notebook tab. It might be worthwhile separating them out into two windows and arranging them across the screen in such a way that you can look at both the terminal and the notebook. You will be required to edit some files on the command line. This can be done in `nano`, if the notebooks are run as part of the CCPBioSim online training. If you happen to be running this notebook on your computer at home feel free to use whatever editor that works for you to edit required files. \n",

In the perturbation between ethane and methanol the first C atom (C1), will stay a C atom but the partial charges on the molecule will change because of the changed environment from initially having a methyl group attached to it to an OH group attached after the transformation. The second C atom will change to being an oxygen atom after the perturbation. You can now see how the initial atom type is `c3`, and the final atom type is `oh`, meaning that we are going from an sp3 hybridised carbon atom to an oxygen atom that is bonded to a hydrogen. The Lennard-Jones terms change a little and the partial charges do too. The alchemical free energy software can then create a linear perturbation between the initial and final values to slowly morph from one to the other.  "
