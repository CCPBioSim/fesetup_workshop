    "\n",
    "FESetup is a predominantly command line based tool. Executing commands in a notebook cell is possible but it is easier to work in a terminal. To open the terminal from the Jupyter home page click on New and then Terminal. To work with this notebook you will have to switch between the terminal tab and the notebook tab. It might be worthwhile separating them out into two windows and arranging them across the screen in such a way that you can look at both the terminal and the notebook. You will be required to edit some files on the command line. This can be done in `nano`, if the notebooks are run as part of the CCPBioSim online training. If you happen to be running this notebook on your computer at home feel free to use whatever editor that works for you to edit required files. \n",
